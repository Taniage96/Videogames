# Video Game Sales Analysis Project

## Project Description

This project analyzes video game sales data for the online store Ice, which sells video games worldwide. The goal is to identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. This will allow the store to spot promising projects and plan advertising campaigns.

The data available covers the period up to 2016. The task is to plan a campaign for 2017, using the available historical data.

The project focuses on gaining practical experience in working with data, regardless of whether it's predicting sales for 2017 based on 2016 data or sales for 2027 based on 2026 data.

The dataset includes a "rating" column, which stores the ESRB rating of each game. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates game content and assigns age ratings such as Teen or Adult.
